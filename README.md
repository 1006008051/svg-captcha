# svg captcha

generate svg captcha in node.js

## useful if you

- cannot or do not want to use google recaptcha
- have issue with install c++ addon

## why use svg?

My colleage and I have issue installing c++ addon on windows and we don't want to mess with python and visual studio.  
Initially we thought that using svg will result in larger file,  
but it turns out that it's smaller than the jpeg captcha.
